# Efficient and scalable posterior surrogate for seismic inversion

Welcome to the website for our research on wavelet score-based generative models for seismic inversion. This site presents our work on developing efficient and scalable posterior surrogates for seismic inversion using wavelet score-based generative models.

## Abstract

Seismic inversion poses significant computational challenges due to its high dimensionality and non-unique solutions. We propose a novel method integrating the Wavelet Score-Based Generative Model (WSGM) with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to enable efficient posterior sampling for full-waveform inference.
